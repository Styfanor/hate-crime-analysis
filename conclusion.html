          <h2 class="title-section">Conclusion over all Analysis</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>Our visualizations have given us a better understanding of the Hate Crime Data and have allowed us to come
            to conclusions about Hate Crime in San Diego. We discovered that the timeline for Hate Crimes is important
            as the years leading up to 2001 generally increased with 2001 as the highest peak which we attributed to the
            aftermath of 9/11. After 2001, however, there was a slow decrease over the years. The most common locations
            for Hate Crimes to be committed are the public highway, road, alley, street, or sidewalk and the most common
            form of offense is destruction, damage, or vandalism of property. One of our major findings is that race is
            the most popular motivation behind the offender’s Hate Crimes as over half of the cases stemmed from racial
            issues.</p>

            <p>We also discovered that the Normal Heights neighborhood and south of the Little Italy neighborhood have the
            highest crime rates in San Diego. Our investigation helped us determine that there is a significant amount
            of both male suspects and male victims compared to the female counterparts and that the most targeted races
            are White, Black and Hispanic.</p>

           <p>Given our findings, we can suggest more surveillance in roads, alleys, and streets in particular near Normal
            Heights and Little Italy may help prevent Hate Crimes. When most people think of ‘Hate Crimes’ they may
            instantly think of contact violence, however as we uncovered, the most common form of Hate Crime is
            destruction and vandalism. An offender may destroy someone’s property based on their biases, but the victim
            may not have property insurance and may not get compensation. For this reason, our analysis could be used to
            argue that there should be legislation to compensate victims when they lack property insurance. We also
            discovered race is the most prominent motivation for committing a Hate Crime, therefore we recommend
            training seminars in workplaces and schools that focus on racial biases. Finally, we believe that raising
            awareness of the nature of Hate Crimes and decreasing the stigma of reporting for the victims would be
            beneficial, as increased data could in turn help create better policies or procedures for combating Hate
            Crime. Awareness campaigns should aim to incorporate strategies for people of all backgrounds and cultures,
            particularly those that may be less likely to feel comfortable reporting. We understand that much more can
            be done to help decrease Hate Crimes in San Diego and across the nation, but based on our findings we have
            provided some suggestions where San Diego can start.</p>
